## BIOSEMI-ACTIVE TWO SET UP, RECORDING AND CLEANUP

### Step 1:
Prepare supplies and equipment:

* Prepare gel, syringes (fill 10cc of gel if one syringe or 5cc if 2 syringes)
* Prepare rings, flat type electrodes, electrodes, cap
* Prepare AD box and battery 

### Step 2:
Prepare the Recording computer and test the triggers. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Always make sure to test the triggers before starting the cap preparation. 

### Step 3:
Measure the head circumference and choose cap size.

### Step 4:
Measure Nasion to Inion distance and find the vertex (cz). This is halfway between the two points.

### Step 5: 
Place mastoids before cap. Don't place them too high or too low. Too high may pick up temporalis muscle and too low may pick up neck muscle.

### Step 6:
Put the head-cap:

* Make sure that the vertex is halfway between nasion and inion 
* Apply gel 
* Insert electrodes 
* Add EOG electrodes 
* Add CMS/DRL electrodes last 

### Step 7:
Check electrode contact:

* **BLUE LIGHT SHOULD BE ON**. This means that CM is in range. 
* **LOW OFFSETS**. All electrodes should have offsets less than +-40mv. To check this, when you open Active Two click **START** (top left) and then **ELECTRODE OFFSETS**.
* **STABLE OFFSETS**. All offsets should be stable when you touch the wires near the participant's head.
* **NO OUTLIERS**. Signals should be similar in size and frequency content accross all channels. Turn off filters and set reference to NONE.

### Step 8: 
Start file. Specify which channels to save, path, and file name.

### Step 9:
Start stimulus presentation.
